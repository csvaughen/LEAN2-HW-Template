# LEAN2-HW-Template

this is the repo where I'll post the LEAN2-HW assignment for MAT 211

the work here is adapted from "The Mechanics of Proof" by Heather Macbeth

 [The Mechanics of Proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001), by [Heather Macbeth](https://faculty.fordham.edu/hmacbeth1), was originally developed for the course Math 2001 at Fordham University.

The Lean files corresponding to each chapter of the book are in the folder [`Math2001`](https://github.com/hrmacbeth/math2001/tree/main/Math2001).
